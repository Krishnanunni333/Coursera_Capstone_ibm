Lots of students, workers, businessmen, etc are migrating to London and if they are going for the first time then they don't know where in London to settle. This leads to many problems within the mind of an individual as well as it may affect his/her social well being. They have very high risk of falling into the traps of robbers, thugs, smugglers, etc. They may get involved in crimes or may become a victim. So, to help these people can Data Science do something?
